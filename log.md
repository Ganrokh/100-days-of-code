# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day -3: Monday, September 17th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Bought Colt Steele's "The Web Developer Bootcamp" course on Udemy. Watched the first introduction video.

**Thoughts:** I have that giddy feeling that I always have when I'm starting something new. I'm excited. Let's hope that I can stick to it.


### Day -2: Tuesday, September 18th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Went through the syllabus for the course, installed Sublime Text Editor.

**Thoughts:** I took a web design class in high school. We were taught using Microsoft Frontpage and Adobe Dreamweaver. I see that Dreamweaver still sees some use, but I'm surprised (okay, maybe not) to see that Microsoft Frontpage was discontinued. What's more, I took this class around 2009-2010. Front Page was discontinued in 2006. I'm not surprised that we were taught to use outdated software.

  I like how Sublime is lightweight while being very intuitive. I work on a Windows laptop, but it's big, bulky, and is sort of a pain to travel with. I enjoy having a Chromebook when I travel, so I'm interested in my options for coding from a Chromebook. This shows me that web dev is one possibility.


### Day -1: Wednesday, September 19th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Very early, very basic HTML.

**Thoughts:** I'm actually surprising myself right now. When I took that class in high school, we learned HTML and CSS. I've barely looked at HTML since that class, yet I'm remembering it all almost perfectly as I work through the beginner's HTML part of this course. It actually makes me very happy because it's one of those little reminders that I'm actually learning and retaining information. A week ago, A friend asked me if I knew anything about Python. I took part of a beginner's course earlier this year, so I had basic knowledge. His friend needed help with a project that wasn't working. I actually knew what the problem was. I was surprised. That was another one of these moments.

  Something that strikes me as weird: the depreciation of "b" and "i" for "strong" and "em". I get what Colt was saying about how the developers of HTML want tags to mean something, but I don't really *get* what that means. "em" means that you're emphasising something. "strong" indicates important text. But didn't "b" and "i" already do that? Bold text meant importance, italicized text meant emphasis? Either way, while "b" and "i" still work, I like future-proofing, so I'll adjust to "strong" and "em". I was about to say that it may take awhile for me to fully adjust and break the habit of "b" and "i", but I'm constantly thinking about why they were changed, so it's always on my mind. This will likely be an easy transition.


### Day 0: Thursday, September 20th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** More basic HTML stuffs created my GitHub account (hello!)

**Thoughts:** This is mainly more review. We're getting into "div" and "span", which is something I only sort of remember. I don't fully grasp them yet. "div" seems to be about "wrapping" or blocking big sections of pages and text, and "span" is for smaller bits of text and images? I'm not sure. I'm not fully grasping them yet, but I don't remember struggling with them in my class years ago. Maybe it's just a matterm of it not clicking yet.
  
  I thought more about "em" and "strong". I think I now know what it means that HTML tags need to be meaningful. "Bold" doesn't mean that text is important, it just means that it's slightly more vivid in appearance. "Italicize" doesn't mean that something is emphasized, it just means that text is slightly slanted.
  
  I also setup my GitHub account today. I've only slightly used GitHub in the past. I know its purpose, but I never really understood a lot of the terms. Git? Pull Request? Commit? I know what "fork" is from my experience in cryptocurrency.


### Day 1: Friday, September 21st, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Discovered the 100 Days of Code challenge. Made a long string of tweets on Twitter about why I'm deciding to do this. Learned more about using GitHub. Learned about HTML tables. Began basic CSS like fonts, font sizes, font color, image sizes, etc.

**Thoughts:** Since a great part of my learning this week has been mainly review and setting up various accounts and software, I'm considering today day 1. Today, things change. GitHub seems pretty intimidating on the outside, but maybe that's just a thin veil for an easy-to-use service. 

  I like Colt Steele's method of teaching. I almost wish I could physically attend one of his classes. I like the Pokemon table he had us make. During weeknights, I watch TV with my mom while I work on my laptop. I plan on using these times to work on FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project since I prefer to not have sound on during this time, or use headphones. I took my first look at TOP and FCC tonight. I prefer FCC's method of "look at this piece of code, now you do it" to TOP's "here's everything you need to know, now do this big project". I wish TOP jumped into HTML/CSS quicker to match FCC and the Udemy class. I'm thinking about pausing TOP for now because I'm not sure if it's a good idea to learn Ruby and JavaScript at the same time. I learned Kotlin and Java at the same time, but frameworks like JS and Ruby seem more in-depth.
  
  As for what I actually learned, it still feels somewhat like review. For HTML, I learned about tables. That was mostly review. I'm still in HTML for the Udemy course, but I did enough FreeCodeCamp to get into CSS. CSS doesn't feel like review, but it still feels somewhat familiar, and I took to it quickly. Assigning classes is new to me, though. All and all, this feels like the tip of the iceberg.


### Day 2: Saturday, September 22nd, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Learned about form tags in HTML.

**Thoughts:** I like form tags. I like all of the different options for them. They feel *slightly* overwhelming, but that's okay. Part of me is afraid that I won't remember how to make all different kinds of forms, but I have to remember that programming is partially about the art of googling. I used my newfound knowledge to make a very basic D&D 5e character sheet. I'm not uploading it yet because it can take a lot more work and look much better, but Matt Mercer would be proud.


### Day 3: Tuesday, September 25th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** More practice with form tags in HTML.

**Thoughts:** Form tags seem complex and slightly overwhelming in terms of all of their attributes and how they interconnect. I don't want to admit how convoluted they seem because I know that much more complex things await me in coding. I'll get used to it. At least I'm realizing the power of the MDN Web Docs and Stack Overflow!


### Day 4: Wednesday, September 26th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Covered a ton of CSS. Advanced selectors, specificity, inheritance, etc.

**Thoughts:** So many different types of selectors and governing rules of specificity. I can tell that I'm slowly memorizing everything. What's more important, I've realized that I can now tell the difference between poorly-written HTML/CSS and good HTML/CSS.


### Day 5: Thursday, September 27th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Covered a lot more of CSS, mainly about the box model.

**Thoughts:** The box model is something that I've noticed a lot through the years, anytime I need to inspect a page for whatever reason. I've always noticed a box shape around everthing, no matter what shape anything was. I'm sort of glad to know that I was picking up on some concept in the past and wasn't even aware of it. I can't wait to work more with box models.

I've come to the realization today that a lot of famcy webpages that I've seen through the years aren't collections of well-played pictures, but are just pages with really fancy and complex CSS. That's slightly intimidating, honestly. I can't wait until I can do that.


### Day 6: Friday, September 28th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked with colors, hues, and animations with pure CSS.

**Thoughts:** I'm amazed at how much you can do with animation using CSS. I'm not an artsy person. I never took any art classes in school besides photography. The fact that I can essentially "code" my way to making good, basic art and animations using pure CSS makes me a little glad. I'll still likely need to get good with graphic design, though. Also, I'm having a hard time understanding Bezier Curves. 


### Day 7: Monday, October 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress:** More CSS practice, mainly with layouts. Made a photo blog and a Tic-Tac-Toe board.

**Thoughts:** I'm glad to start making things that look somewhat-decent. Even if it's just a page of photos and getting them to line up properly, that is more exciting than basic text. I mainly worked on the Udemy course today. Day 6 was FreeCodeCamp, which is where got into CSS shapes. I'm not that far yet with Colt Steele's course. I tend to have an easier time learning from Colt Steele than I do FCC, but that may be because he tends to do a lot more examples and bigger projects that have several concepts working together. That said, I'm still gaining a lot from FCC as well.


### Day 8: Tuesday, October 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Made a simple blog with pure HTML & CSS.

**Thoughts:** I'm going to keep this short because it's late and I have an early day tomorrow. Following Colt steele's course, today, I made a simple blog. It's nothing too flashy, just a page showcasing two blog posts using HTML and CSS. This is the first thing that I've made from scratch without outside help or guidance. It's a weird feeling. I'm proud of it, but I also know that this is something that was very simple to do. Also, I used Bacon Ipsum, so now I'm hungry.


### Day[9]: Wednesday, October 3rd, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Studied accessibility tags.

**Thoughts:** Man, there are a lot of these. As someone who is lucky enough to not have need of accessibility anything, it's going to be hard to remember to utilize these. I should be starting FreeCodeCamp's responsive web design projects by Friday. Exciting!


### Day 10: Thursday, October 4th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Studied Bootstrap and Flexbox.

**Thoughts:** I really like Bootstrap. It's easy to use, and their documentation is phenomenal. That said, I initially felt like it was cheating in a way. My hunch is that a lot of people felt that way as well whenever they first learned Bootstrap. However, once I started looking at some of the stock Boostrap features, I started recognizing some from other websites that I use. I started inspecting other websites and realized that a ton of professional sites use Bootstrap. It makes sense now. There's no need to reinvent the wheel. That makes me feel better.

Flexbox is more intimidating. Like a lot of other things in CSS, it's one of those things that just has tons of different options, and it's going to be a while for me to simply get good at using it.


### Day 11: Friday, October 5th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished the first 2 responsive web design projects on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** First two projects down and accepted! One was fun. The other, I was started getting really tired and wanted to get it done. One I'm proud of, the other could use more work to look better (even though I intentionally gave it a terrible background). I'll likely go back to fix it up later.

### Day 12: Tuesday, October 9th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished the third responsive web design project on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** A few days ago, I made a prduct landing page myself without realizing that it would be a future project in FCC. I decided to copy my HTML/CSS from that page into CodePen and tried to add everything that the project needed.

It was much harder than I thought it would be. I designed that page using Bootstrap, and some elements that were needed for the FCC project weren't sitting well with Bootstrap, so I had to rewrite parts of the page. In addition to this, I was starting to get really sleepy, so I decided to "brute force" some of the tests. It broke parts of the page, but the page ended up passing all of the tests. Well, almost all. The media query test is bugged and will only accept a specific media query, which I had to google to find. All and all, the page doesn't look *great* and parts of it are clearly broken, but I'll fix it later.

### Day 13: Thursday, October 11th, 2018 (Morning)

**Today's Progress:** Finished most of the HTML for the FreeCodeCamp documentation project.

**Thoughts:** I normally do my coding at night. However, I was really tired last night and couldn't focus. As a result, I decided to do an hour early this morning, and another hour late night tonight.

I finished most of the HTML for the documentation project, everything except the navbar. I've come to realize that I can sit down and pump out a ton of pure HTML no problem, but I'm not able to do the same with CSS yet. I need to work on my CSS more. I can envision how I want a page to look, I just have a hard time figuring out where to start with the CSS.


### Day 14: Thursday, October 11th, 2018 (Evening)

**Today's Progress:** Finished the rest of the FreeCodeCamp responsive web design projects. Earned the certificate.

**Thoughts:** I'm proud of myself. I got the certificate! Yay! I stayed up way too late to finish that last project!

I am really excited to be moving on to JavaScript. I'm a much better coder than I am a designer. I guess you could say that I'm more of a backend person. However, I want to be fullstack, so at some point, I need to dig deeper into CSS and really learn it. I still feel like a CSS newbie.

### Day 15: Friday, October 12th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Brushed up on CSS in my FCC projects. Began learning JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** I really like JavaScript. I'm much more of a coder than I am a designer. Even though this is the first time I'm learning JS, I'm familiar with Python and Kotlin. Being familiar with them makes JavaScript easier to learn. It's the same concepts, like variables, boolean, if/else statements, etc, just with different syntax.


### Day 16: Monday, October 15th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Practiced JavaScript for and while loops.

**Thoughts:** Just like with if/else statements, I noticed that the loop syntax for Javascript is similar to other languages that I'm familiar with, so this wasn't hard at all for me to pick up.


### Day 17: Tuesday, October 16th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Practiced JavaScript functions.

**Thoughts:** I have less experience with functions than I do with other aspects of JavaScript based on my experience with other languages. However, I still picked up functions pretty easily. That said, I think I need to practice loops more.


### Day 18: Wednesday, October 17th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** More practice with JavaScript functions.

**Thoughts:** I'm having a little bit of a hard time grasping local variables and global variables. I get their differences, I just don't think I'm really grasping the proper syntax. Needing to reference the materials a lot. I'm also struggling a bit with the idea of functions returning undefined variables. I just need more practice.


### Day 19: Thursday, October 18th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Even more practice with JavaScript functions, this time on HackerRank and LeetCode.

**Thoughts:** I decided to practice functions more before moving on in FreeCodeCamp or the Udemy course. I've heard a lot of talk about HackerRank and LeetCode being good for practice problems. I tried HackerRank first. I don't like how there is so much boilerplate to deal with in each problem. I tried LeetCode after that. There is much less boilerplate to deal with. It's much easier to jump in and start working on the solution instead of figuring out where the solution needs to go in the boilerplate. I'm still going to use both going forward (since apparently recruiters look at both), but I'll likely be devoting more time to LeetCode.


### Day 20: Friday, October 19th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** More practice with basic JavaScript, mainly functions, array manipulation, and objects.

**Thoughts:** I'm getting better with JS. The only thing that I'm rocky with is global vs local variables in functions, and how to properly use "return" in functions. I just need more practice.


### Day 21: Monday, October 22nd, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed JavaScript challenges on HackerRank.

**Thoughts:** I didn't have a lot of time today, so I spent it doing daily challenges on HackerRank (I still like LeetCode better, but HackerRank has a "30 Days of Code" thing that I'm doing). It was mainly working with loops and if/else statments. I hate figuring out how to navigate their boilerplate, but as least I'm still practicing JavaScript concepts.


### Day 22: Tuesday, October 23rd, 2018

**Today's Progress:** More practice with JavaScript loops.

**Thoughts:** Today was practice with nesting JavaScript loops and if/else statements. I'm good at them. I need more practice with working with arrays.


### Day 23: Wednesday, October 24th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Practiced CSS using Bootstrap 4.

**Thoughts:** Colt Steele's class is about to push into JS arrays and objects while FreeCodeCamp is about to push into Regex. I decided to spend today practicing CSS and Bootstrap 4. I'm not great at CSS, and both of my courses are currently diving into JavaScript. I don't know if I'll ever be great at CSS, but I don't want to learn what skills I've managed to pick up.


### Day 24: Thursday, October 25th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** More practice with CSS using Bootstrap 4.

**Thoughts:** More practice with CSS. CSS is one of the few things that I don't think I'll ever feel confident with. I'm just not artistically-inclined. I'm good with perfecting layouts and colors, but I'm terrible with animations and making anything original using pure CSS.


### Day 25: Friday, October 26th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Last day of CSS practice. Made a mock Battle.net homepage.

**Thoughts:** Today was going to be my last dedicated CSS practice day for awhile. I made a mock Blizzard Battle.net homepage. Nothing fancy. I like how it turned out. I need more practice with the Bootstrap classes that change margins/borders/etc.

**Link to Project:** https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Ganrokh/Mock-BattleNet-Homepage/blob/master/index.html


### Day 26: Wednesday, October 31st, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Returned to JavaScript array practice.

**Thoughts:** I had to take a couple extra days off because it's the end of the month and work got busy. Today, I returned to learning JavaScript, mainly arrays. I've been on arrays for a few days now, but I want them completely drilled into my head. I mainly just practiced various methods with them.


### Day 27: Thursday, November 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Made a Todo list app with JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** This is the first "real thing" that I've made with JS. It was pretty easy to make. Obviously it's rudimentary and requires typing commands to get it to work. I'm starting to understand the importance of user-friendly UI.


### Day 28: Tuesday, November 6th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** JavaScript array and objects practice.

**Thoughts:** Life getting busy again and a general lack of energy forced me to take a few days off again. I used my day back to practice array and object manipulation. Surprisingly, I haven't forgotten a thing in my short haitus. Yay!


### Day 29: Wednesday, November 7th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** JavaScript objects and methods practice.

**Thoughts:** Getting better with JS objects. Today, I learned about methods. They were a bit hard to grasp at first (actually using a method found in an object), but then I found out that JS libraries (even the console) are just objects filled with methods. That's made them easier to understand.


### Day 30: Thursday, November 8th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** First introduction to DOM manipulation.

**Thoughts:** I had no idea what to expect going into DOM manipulation. For all other terms and jargon in coding, I've at least heard of. That's not the case with DOM. It makes sense now that it's what allows JavaScript to work with HTML. Selectors are pretty easy to grasp, just need to work on the syntax. The fact that HTML tags are by default JavaScript objects sort of blows my mind.


### Day 31: Friday, November 9th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** First introduction to RegEx.

**Thoughts:** RegEx is interesting. All the little snytaxes are interesting. The concept is easy to grasp, it's just hard understanding all of the different little Syntaxes. I appreciate FreeCodeCamp for simplifying everything, but I think some of the challenges regarding certain syntaxes were simplified too much. I had to do extra googling to really understand them. I have a feeling that I'm going to be studying RegEx a lot just to better understand the syntax.


### Day 32: Saturday, November 10th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** First introduction to debugging and data structures.

**Thoughts:** Data science has always been a massive interest to me. I just love looking at data and working with it. If I was back in college 6 years ago and I knew that data science was even a field of study, I likely would have pursued it. I know that data structures are a very basic concept of data science, but I'm happy to even be at the very tip of the iceberg of the field. I can't wait to start the algorithm section of FreeCodeCamp.
