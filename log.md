# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day -3: Monday, September 17th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Bought Colt Steele's "The Web Developer Bootcamp" course on Udemy. Watched the first introduction video.

**Thoughts:** I have that giddy feeling that I always have when I'm starting something new. I'm excited. Let's hope that I can stick to it.


### Day -2: Tuesday, September 18th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Went through the syllabus for the course, installed Sublime Text Editor.

**Thoughts:** I took a web design class in high school. We were taught using Microsoft Frontpage and Adobe Dreamweaver. I see that Dreamweaver still sees some use, but I'm surprised (okay, maybe not) to see that Microsoft Frontpage was discontinued. What's more, I took this class around 2009-2010. Front Page was discontinued in 2006. I'm not surprised that we were taught to use outdated software.

  I like how Sublime is lightweight while being very intuitive. I work on a Windows laptop, but it's big, bulky, and is sort of a pain to travel with. I enjoy having a Chromebook when I travel, so I'm interested in my options for coding from a Chromebook. This shows me that web dev is one possibility.


### Day -1: Wednesday, September 19th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Very early, very basic HTML.

**Thoughts:** I'm actually surprising myself right now. When I took that class in high school, we learned HTML and CSS. I've barely looked at HTML since that class, yet I'm remembering it all almost perfectly as I work through the beginner's HTML part of this course. It actually makes me very happy because it's one of those little reminders that I'm actually learning and retaining information. A week ago, A friend asked me if I knew anything about Python. I took part of a beginner's course earlier this year, so I had basic knowledge. His friend needed help with a project that wasn't working. I actually knew what the problem was. I was surprised. That was another one of these moments.

  Something that strikes me as weird: the depreciation of "b" and "i" for "strong" and "em". I get what Colt was saying about how the developers of HTML want tags to mean something, but I don't really *get* what that means. "em" means that you're emphasising something. "strong" indicates important text. But didn't "b" and "i" already do that? Bold text meant importance, italicized text meant emphasis? Either way, while "b" and "i" still work, I like future-proofing, so I'll adjust to "strong" and "em". I was about to say that it may take awhile for me to fully adjust and break the habit of "b" and "i", but I'm constantly thinking about why they were changed, so it's always on my mind. This will likely be an easy transition.


### Day 0: Thursday, September 20th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** More basic HTML stuffs created my GitHub account (hello!)

**Thoughts:** This is mainly more review. We're getting into "div" and "span", which is something I only sort of remember. I don't fully grasp them yet. "div" seems to be about "wrapping" or blocking big sections of pages and text, and "span" is for smaller bits of text and images? I'm not sure. I'm not fully grasping them yet, but I don't remember struggling with them in my class years ago. Maybe it's just a matterm of it not clicking yet.
  
  I thought more about "em" and "strong". I think I now know what it means that HTML tags need to be meaningful. "Bold" doesn't mean that text is important, it just means that it's slightly more vivid in appearance. "Italicize" doesn't mean that something is emphasized, it just means that text is slightly slanted.
  
  I also setup my GitHub account today. I've only slightly used GitHub in the past. I know its purpose, but I never really understood a lot of the terms. Git? Pull Request? Commit? I know what "fork" is from my experience in cryptocurrency.


### Day 1: Friday, September 21st, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Discovered the 100 Days of Code challenge. Made a long string of tweets on Twitter about why I'm deciding to do this. Learned more about using GitHub. Learned about HTML tables. Began basic CSS like fonts, font sizes, font color, image sizes, etc.

**Thoughts:** Since a great part of my learning this week has been mainly review and setting up various accounts and software, I'm considering today day 1. Today, things change. GitHub seems pretty intimidating on the outside, but maybe that's just a thin veil for an easy-to-use service. 

  I like Colt Steele's method of teaching. I almost wish I could physically attend one of his classes. I like the Pokemon table he had us make. During weeknights, I watch TV with my mom while I work on my laptop. I plan on using these times to work on FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project since I prefer to not have sound on during this time, or use headphones. I took my first look at TOP and FCC tonight. I prefer FCC's method of "look at this piece of code, now you do it" to TOP's "here's everything you need to know, now do this big project". I wish TOP jumped into HTML/CSS quicker to match FCC and the Udemy class. I'm thinking about pausing TOP for now because I'm not sure if it's a good idea to learn Ruby and JavaScript at the same time. I learned Kotlin and Java at the same time, but frameworks like JS and Ruby seem more in-depth.
  
  As for what I actually learned, it still feels somewhat like review. For HTML, I learned about tables. That was mostly review. I'm still in HTML for the Udemy course, but I did enough FreeCodeCamp to get into CSS. CSS doesn't feel like review, but it still feels somewhat familiar, and I took to it quickly. Assigning classes is new to me, though. All and all, this feels like the tip of the iceberg.


### Day 2: Saturday, September 22nd, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Learned about form tags in HTML.

**Thoughts:** I like form tags. I like all of the different options for them. They feel *slightly* overwhelming, but that's okay. Part of me is afraid that I won't remember how to make all different kinds of forms, but I have to remember that programming is partially about the art of googling. I used my newfound knowledge to make a very basic D&D 5e character sheet. I'm not uploading it yet because it can take a lot more work and look much better, but Matt Mercer would be proud.


### Day 3: Tuesday, September 25th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** More practice with form tags in HTML.

**Thoughts:** Form tags seem complex and slightly overwhelming in terms of all of their attributes and how they interconnect. I don't want to admit how convoluted they seem because I know that much more complex things await me in coding. I'll get used to it. At least I'm realizing the power of the MDN Web Docs and Stack Overflow!


### Day 4: Wednesday, September 26th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Covered a ton of CSS. Advanced selectors, specificity, inheritance, etc.

**Thoughts:** So many different types of selectors and governing rules of specificity. I can tell that I'm slowly memorizing everything. What's more important, I've realized that I can now tell the difference between poorly-written HTML/CSS and good HTML/CSS.


### Day 5: Thursday, September 27th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Covered a lot more of CSS, mainly about the box model.

**Thoughts:** The box model is something that I've noticed a lot through the years, anytime I need to inspect a page for whatever reason. I've always noticed a box shape around everthing, no matter what shape anything was. I'm sort of glad to know that I was picking up on some concept in the past and wasn't even aware of it. I can't wait to work more with box models.

I've come to the realization today that a lot of famcy webpages that I've seen through the years aren't collections of well-played pictures, but are just pages with really fancy and complex CSS. That's slightly intimidating, honestly. I can't wait until I can do that.


### Day 6: Friday, September 28th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Worked with colors, hues, and animations with pure CSS.

**Thoughts:** I'm amazed at how much you can do with animation using CSS. I'm not an artsy person. I never took any art classes in school besides photography. The fact that I can essentially "code" my way to making good, basic art and animations using pure CSS makes me a little glad. I'll still likely need to get good with graphic design, though. Also, I'm having a hard time understanding Bezier Curves. 


### Day 7: Monday, October 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress:** More CSS practice, mainly with layouts. Made a photo blog and a Tic-Tac-Toe board.

**Thoughts:** I'm glad to start making things that look somewhat-decent. Even if it's just a page of photos and getting them to line up properly, that is more exciting than basic text. I mainly worked on the Udemy course today. Day 6 was FreeCodeCamp, which is where got into CSS shapes. I'm not that far yet with Colt Steele's course. I tend to have an easier time learning from Colt Steele than I do FCC, but that may be because he tends to do a lot more examples and bigger projects that have several concepts working together. That said, I'm still gaining a lot from FCC as well.


### Day 8: Tuesday, October 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Made a simple blog with pure HTML & CSS.

**Thoughts:** I'm going to keep this short because it's late and I have an early day tomorrow. Following Colt steele's course, today, I made a simple blog. It's nothing too flashy, just a page showcasing two blog posts using HTML and CSS. This is the first thing that I've made from scratch without outside help or guidance. It's a weird feeling. I'm proud of it, but I also know that this is something that was very simple to do. Also, I used Bacon Ipsum, so now I'm hungry.


### Day[9]: Wednesday, October 3rd, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Studied accessibility tags.

**Thoughts:** Man, there are a lot of these. As someone who is lucky enough to not have need of accessibility anything, it's going to be hard to remember to utilize these. I should be starting FreeCodeCamp's responsive web design projects by Friday. Exciting!


### Day 10: Thursday, October 5th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Studied Bootstrap and Flexbox.

**Thoughts:** I really like Bootstrap. It's easy to use, and their documentation is phenomenal. That said, I initially felt like it was cheating in a way. My hunch is that a lot of people felt that way as well whenever they first learned Bootstrap. However, once I started looking at some of the stock Boostrap features, I started recognizing some from other websites that I use. I started inspecting other websites and realized that a ton of professional sites use Bootstrap. It makes sense now. There's no need to reinvent the wheel. That makes me feel better.

Flexbox is more intimidating. Like a lot of other things in CSS, it's one of those things that just has tons of different options, and it's going to be a while for me to simply get good at using it.


### Day 11: Friday, October 6th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finished the first 2 responsive web design projects on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** First two projects down and accepted! One was fun. The other, I was started getting really tired and wanted to get it done. One I'm proud of, the other could use more work to look better (even though I intentionally gave it a terrible background). I'll likely go back to fix it up later.
