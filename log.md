# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day -3: Monday, September 17th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Bought Colt Steele's "The Web Developer Bootcamp" course on Udemy. Watched the first introduction video.

**Thoughts:** I have that giddy feeling that I always have when I'm starting something new. I'm excited. Let's hope that I can stick to it.


### Day -2: Tuesday, September 18th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Went through the syllabus for the course, installed Sublime Text Editor.

**Thoughts:** I took a web design class in high school. We were taught using Microsoft Frontpage and Adobe Dreamweaver. I see that Dreamweaver still sees some use, but I'm surprised (okay, maybe not) to see that Microsoft Frontpage was discontinued. What's more, I took this class around 2009-2010. Front Page was discontinued in 2006. I'm not surprised that we were taught to use outdated software.

  I like how Sublime is lightweight while being very intuitive. I work on a Windows laptop, but it's big, bulky, and is sort of a pain to travel with. I enjoy having a Chromebook when I travel, so I'm interested in my options for coding from a Chromebook. This shows me that web dev is one possibility.


### Day -1: Wednesday, September 19th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Very early, very basic HTML.

**Thoughts:** I'm actually surprising myself right now. When I took that class in high school, we learned HTML and CSS. I've barely looked at HTML since that class, yet I'm remembering it all almost perfectly as I work through the beginner's HTML part of this course. It actually makes me very happy because it's one of those little reminders that I'm actually learning and retaining information. A week ago, A friend asked me if I knew anything about Python. I took part of a beginner's course earlier this year, so I had basic knowledge. His friend needed help with a project that wasn't working. I actually knew what the problem was. I was surprised. That was another one of these moments.

  Something that strikes me as weird: the depreciation of "b" and "i" for "strong" and "em". I get what Colt was saying about how the developers of HTML want tags to mean something, but I don't really *get* what that means. "em" means that you're emphasising something. "strong" indicates important text. But didn't "b" and "i" already do that? Bold text meant importance, italicized text meant emphasis? Either way, while "b" and "i" still work, I like future-proofing, so I'll adjust to "strong" and "em". I was about to say that it may take awhile for me to fully adjust and break the habit of "b" and "i", but I'm constantly thinking about why they were changed, so it's always on my mind. This will likely be an easy transition.


### Day 0: Thursday, September 20th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** More basic HTML stuffs created my GitHub account (hello!)

**Thoughts:** This is mainly more review. We're getting into "div" and "span", which is something I only sort of remember. I don't fully grasp them yet. "div" seems to be about "wrapping" or blocking big sections of pages and text, and "span" is for smaller bits of text and images? I'm not sure. I'm not fully grasping them yet, but I don't remember struggling with them in my class years ago. Maybe it's just a matterm of it not clicking yet.
  
  I thought more about "em" and "strong". I think I now know what it means that HTML tags need to be meaningful. "Bold" doesn't mean that text is important, it just means that it's slightly more vivid in appearance. "Italicize" doesn't mean that something is emphasized, it just means that text is slightly slanted.
  
  I also setup my GitHub account today. I've only slightly used GitHub in the past. I know its purpose, but I never really understood a lot of the terms. Git? Pull Request? Commit? I know what "fork" is from my experience in cryptocurrency.


### Day 1: Friday, September 21th, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Discovered the 100 Days of Code challenge. Made a long string of tweets on Twitter about why I'm deciding to do this. Learned more about using GitHub. Learned about HTML tables. Began basic CSS like fonts, font sizes, font color, image sizes, etc.

**Thoughts:** Since a great part of my learning this week has been mainly review and setting up various accounts and software, I'm considering today day 1. Today, things change. GitHub seems pretty intimidating on the outside, but maybe that's just a thin veil for an easy-to-use service. 

  I like Colt Steele's method of teaching. I almost wish I could physically attend one of his classes. I like the Pokemon table he had us make. During weeknights, I watch TV with my mom while I work on my laptop. I plan on using these times to work on FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project since I prefer to not have sound on during this time, or use headphones. I took my first look at TOP and FCC tonight. I prefer FCC's method of "look at this piece of code, now you do it" to TOP's "here's everything you need to know, now do this big project". I wish TOP jumped into HTML/CSS quicker to match FCC and the Udemy class. I'm thinking about pausing TOP for now because I'm not sure if it's a good idea to learn Ruby and JavaScript at the same time. I learned Kotlin and Java at the same time, but frameworks like JS and Ruby seem more in-depth.
  
  As for what I actually learned, it still feels somewhat like review. For HTML, I learned about tables. That was mostly review. I'm still in HTML for the Udemy course, but I did enough FreeCodeCamp to get into CSS. CSS doesn't feel like review, but it still feels somewhat familiar, and I took to it quickly. Assigning classes is new to me, though. All and all, this feels like the tip of the iceberg.
